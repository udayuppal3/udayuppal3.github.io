    <div class="bigparagraphs">
      <p class="paragraph">Esteria allows you to tell the mood and interests of party goers. Bars, parties, concerts, you name it. Esteria takes your location and creates a news feed of everyone around you at a party, telling you a person's romantic mood, recent profile picture, sexual orientation, and short custom description. With this app, people who are in relationships can find others also in relationships at a party. Also people who are trying to flirt won't be in that awkward situation of not knowing the relationship status or mood of the person they are talking to or want to talk to. After all, we have all been in a situation where we wanted to talk to someone but did not know if they were single or not, or felt like having a night out on the town to ourselves or with our friends alone away from the dating scene.</p> 
      <p class="paragraph">Esteria is a bridge for talking with someone without the awkward mating dance beforehand or preparation to let them know that ‘you’ve already got yourself someone.’ You are both already on the same page. So, introduce yourself, make it known you’re on the same sheet of music and have a REAL conversation. One without that distracting voice in your head the whole time saying “where is this going?” That’s the beauty of Esteria, you know where it’s going, and you can actually focus on the person in front of you. Esteria is not out to introduce some new overly complicated social media - there’s enough of that already. It’s the simple solution to that little thing we skipped over along the way called socializing. We’re not redefining how people meet other people, we’re just making it easier.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Esteria, making hello easier.</p>

    <p class="smallparagraph">Arbitration and Governing Law.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement
      (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by
      the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have
      the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent
      jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any
      circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other
      representative action or proceeding.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU
      GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company
      (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
      PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a
      NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
      The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are
      usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the
      arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For
      details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or
      vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event
      that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the
      Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts.
      You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the
      United States of America without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration
      agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">Indemnity by You. You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and its
      and their officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand,
      including reasonable attorney's fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of or
      failure to comply with this Agreement (including any breach of your representations and warranties
      contained herein), any postings or Content you post in the Service, and the violation of any law or
      regulation by you. The Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any
      matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the
      Company in connection therewith.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">Notice. The Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this
      Agreement, using any reasonable means now known or hereafter developed, including by email, regular
      mail, SMS, MMS, text message or postings in the Service. Such notices may not be received if you violate
      this Agreement by accessing the Service in an unauthorized manner. You agree that you are deemed to
      have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Service in an
      authorized manner.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">Entire Agreement; Other. This Agreement, with the Privacy Policy and any specific guidelines or rules
      that are separately posted for particular services or offers in the Service, contains the entire agreement
      between you and the Company regarding the use of the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is
      held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the
      Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
      such right or provision. You agree that your online account is non-transferable and all of your rights to
      your profile or contents within your account terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint
      venture or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any
      representations or bind the Company in any manner.</p>
    <p class="smallparagraph">Amendment. This Agreement is subject to change by the Company at any time.</p>

    <div class="smallparagraphs">
      <p class="smallparagraph">Esteria, Inc. (“Esteria,” “we,” and “us”) respects the privacy of its users (“you”) and has developed this
        Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes
        the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your
        choices about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when
        using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our website or application (our
        “Service”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for
        information on how to contact us.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Information we collect about you</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">In General. We may collect information that can identify you such as your name, email address, gender,
        sexual orientation ("personal information") and other information that does not identify you. We may
        collect this information through a website or a mobile application. By using the Service, you are
        authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service. When you provide
        personal information through our Service, the information may be sent to servers located in the United
        States and countries around the world.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Information you provide. In order to register as a user with Esteria, you will be asked or given the option
        to provide personal information such as your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education
        history, relationship interests, current city, photos, and personal descriptions. You will also be asked to
        allow Esteria to collect your location information from your device when you download or use the
        Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our
        Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address,
        email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information. You
        may also provide us photos, a personal description and information about your gender and preferences
        for recommendations, such as search distance, age range and gender. If you contact us with a customer
        service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Use of technologies to collect information. We use various technologies to collect information from your
        device and about your activities on our Service.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Information collected automatically. We automatically collect information from your browser or device
        when you visit our Service. This information could include your IP address, device ID and type, your
        browser type and language, the operating system used by your device, access times, your mobile
        device’s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Cookies and Use of Cookie Data. When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more
        cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of a
        cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the
        pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third
        parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you Esteria advertisements on other sites
        or applications.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Pixel tags. We may use embedded pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads,
        and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as
        how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and
        services. Ad companies also may also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their
        performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Mobile Device IDs: If you're using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a
        device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize
        you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs
        cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in “Settings” on your iPhone. Ad companies also use
        device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad
        performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track
        information about app usage.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Information collected by third-parties for advertising purposes. We may allow service providers,
        advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our
        Service. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect
        information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not provide any non-
        anonymized personal information to third parties.</p>

        position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting
        upon your application. We may retain your personal information, but only for the purpose of
        considering your application for current or future available positions. This information, which may
        include your name and contact information, prior education and experience, and other information you
        provide to us, may be shared with third-party service providers retained by us to collect, maintain and
        analyze candidate submissions for job postings.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">In all circumstances, we may perform these functions directly or use a third party vendor to perform
        these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your personal information only to perform
        services for us.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">With whom we share your information</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Information Shared with Other Users. When you register as a user of Esteria, your Esteria profile will be
        viewable by other users of the Service. Other users will be able to view the personal information we’ve
        listed in Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy you have provided. Those others will include all who reside
        with the 100 meter geolocation that your Esteria profile exists within.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Personal information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this
        Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal
        information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Service providers: We may share information, including personal and financial information, with third
        parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders,

        tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our Service functionality, and supporting
        contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Service. These service providers

        from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend
        against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal
        objection or right available to us.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take
        other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the
        rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with
        applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements
        or policies.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture,
        merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Aggregated and/or non-personal information. We may use and share non-personal information we
        collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with other Match Group companies
        and third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Service and on websites or
        applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-
        personal information we collect with additional non-personal information
        collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal
        information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and
        investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. For
        example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address
        and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your
        browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reﬂect de-identified
        demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email
        address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Third Party Websites</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">Any Third Party Websites that we direct or redirect you to through our Terms of Use or Private Policy
        Agreement work within the same limits. These third- party websites may independently solicit and

      <p class="smallparagraph">Your choices about collection and use of your information</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to

        register as user; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or
        sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.</p>

      <p class="smallparagraph">We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and
        disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure
        your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats,
        or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle
        and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure
        email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website
        athttp://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself

        voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly
        available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address or phone
        number, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what
        other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise
        discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p>

        may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this
        privacy policy.</p>
      <p class="smallparagraph">No Rights of Third Parties</p>
